# 🖥️ Open Source Visual Computing Project

Welcome to our open-source project! 🚀 This repository was created to encourage collaborative development of a system based on **Visual Computing**, using **Python** and some of the main libraries for image processing and graphical interfaces.

## 📌 Project Objective

Our goal is to develop a robust system that utilizes **Computer Vision**, **Visual Computing**, and other technologies for various applications. This project is in its early stages and will evolve with community contributions. Any help is welcome! 🤝

## 🔍 Use Case

🔍 Use Case

Imagine this scenario: your colleagues leave the office at 1 PM on Monday, and when they return on Tuesday morning, they find the office completely empty because it was robbed. Or perhaps someone accidentally left the coffee machine on, causing a short circuit that burned down the entire office.

These situations could be avoided with a system that connects to any camera and instantly sends an alert message to a WhatsApp group when a change is detected.

This project allows real-time monitoring and can run on a local machine (computer) using a simple webcam.



## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used

The project is developed in **Python** and utilizes the following libraries:

- `opencv-python` - Library for image processing and computer vision.
- `opencv-python-headless` - Optimized version for environments without a GUI.
- `numpy` - Library for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `tk` - Toolkit for building graphical interfaces.
